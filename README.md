# Battle Challenge

For the Makers Academy Week 3 challenges, we were introduced to web app development, using local repositories to build a simple web app while following an effective debugging process. This provided an opportunity to explore the MVC pattern of web development, and interact with .erb files, HTML and CSS, and HTTP requests. During the week, I worked with several people's repositories (see credits below) before pushing the last repo I worked on to this repository.

### Challenges 1 - 16: researching our toolset

These challenges were completed with **Tatiana Nantes**, **Leye Oduola** and **Kate Young**, and involved becoming familiar with new systems and technologies. This involved:
- Researching and practicing with HTML GET and POST requests
- Setting up Sinatra, Capybara and Selenium Webdriver, and test-driving a TDD development process with them

#### Challenges 17 and 18: setting up a project
These challenges were completed with **Kate Young**. They involved:
- Creating a Gemfile with relevant links
- Creating a testing suite, including rspec and capybara
- Reviewing basic debugging practices
- Setting up seperate directories to establish an MVC environment

#### Challenges 19 - 23: view and controller basics
These challenges were completed solo. They involved creating code for a basic battle game, where the player continuously attacks the opponent to decrease their health points. This involved TDD development of View and Controller elements, and test driving using sinatra to ensure proper functionality.

#### Challenges 24 - 26: implementing model
These challenges were completed with **Dylan James** and **Will Birdseye**. They involved:
- Implementing models to run logical operations, and linking these models to the controller with POST and GET requests
- Adding more advanced functionality to display player hit points
- Extracting classes to hold logical operations 

### Challenges 27 - 29: multiplayer
These challenges were completed solo. They involved implenting a multiplayer game, where two players could perform actions.
